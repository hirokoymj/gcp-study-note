# HTTP Load Balancer with Autoscaling

[HTTP Load Balancer with Autoscaling](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_sessions/1831826/labs/338562)

**Managed Instance Group**

> Managed instance groups can work with **load balancing services** to **distribute network traffic** to all of the instances in the group. If an instance in the group stops, crashes, or is deleted by an action other than the instance groupâ€™s commands, the managed instance group automatically recreates the instance so it can resume its processing tasks.

> The recreated instance uses the **same name** and the **same instance template** as the previous instance. Managed instance groups can automatically identify and recreate unhealthy instances in a group to ensure that all the instances are running optimally.

**Steps to create MIGs**

1. Create a custom image
2. Create an instance template based on a custom image
3. Migs
4. Feature - Auto scalling

**Autoscaling policy**

ex. vm1(100%) vm2(80%) --> vm1(60%), vm2(60%), vm3(65%)

- CPU utilizatin
- Load balancing capacity
- Monitoring metrics
- Queue-based workload

**Health Check**

- Check interval: 5 secs (how often to check)
- Timeout: 3 secs (how long to wait)
- Healthy threshold: 2 consecutive successes (how many successful attempt)
- Unhealthy threshold: 2 consecutive failures (how many failed attempt)

**Lab: HTTP Load Balancer with Autoscaling**

1. you create two managed instance groups that serve as backends in us-central1 and europe-west1.
2. Then, you create and stress test a load balancer to demonstrate global load balancing and autoscaling.
