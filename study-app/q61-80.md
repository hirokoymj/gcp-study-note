**Question 64**

You are running an application on multiple virtual machines within a managed instance group and have autoscaling enabled. The autoscaling policy is configured so that additional instances are added to the group if the CPU utilization of instances goes above 80%. VMs are added until the instance group reaches its maximum limit of five VMs or until CPU utilization of instances lowers to 80%. The initial delay for HTTP health checks against the instances is set to 30 seconds.

The virtual machine instances take around three minutes to become available for users. You observe that when the instance group autoscales, it adds more instances then necessary to support the levels of end-user traffic. You want to properly maintain instance group sizes when autoscaling. What should you do?

A: Set the maximum number of instances to 1.

B: Decrease the maximum number of instances to 3.

C: Use a TCP health check instead of an HTTP health check.

D: Increase the initial delay of the HTTP health check to 200 seconds.

**Question 65**
You need to select and configure compute resources for a set of batch processing jobs. These jobs take around 2 hours to complete and are run nightly. You want to minimize service costs. What should you do?

A: Select Google Kubernetes Engine. Use a single-node cluster with a small instance type.

B: Select Google Kubernetes Engine. Use a three-node cluster with micro instance types.

C: Select Compute Engine. Use preemptible VM instances of the appropriate standard machine type.

D: Select Compute Engine. Use VM instance types that support micro bursting.

Answer: C

- https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/preemptible
- Compute Engine always stops preemptible instances after they run for 24 hours. Certain actions reset this 24-hour counter.
- Preemptible VM instances are available at much lower price—a 60-91% discount—compared to the price of standard VMs. However, Compute Engine might stop (preempt) these instances if it needs to reclaim the compute capacity for allocation to other VMs. Preemptible instances use excess Compute Engine capacity, so their availability varies with usage.
