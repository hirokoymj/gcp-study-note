**Question 1** Every employee of your company has a Google account. Your operational team needs to manage a large number of instances on Compute Engine. Each member of this team needs only administrative access to the servers. Your security team wants to ensure that the deployment of credentials is operationally efficient and must be able to determine who accessed a given instance.

What should you do?

A: Generate a new SSH key pair. Give the private key to each member of your team. Configure the public key in the metadata of each instance.

B: Ask each member of the team to generate a new SSH key pair and to send you their public key. Use a configuration management tool to deploy those keys on each instance.

C: Ask each member of the team to generate a new SSH key pair and to add the public key to their Google account. Grant the "compute.osAdminLogin" role to the Google group corresponding to this team.

D: Generate a new SSH key pair. Give the private key to each member of your team. Configure the public key as a project-wide public SSH key in your Cloud Platform project and allow project-wide public SSH keys on each instance.

Answer: C

**There are two ways to enable OS login.**

**(1)Enable OS Login using Metadata:**

1. Go to Compute Engine -> Metadata and create key and value.

```
Key: enable-oslogin
Value: TRUE
```

2. Go to IAM and grant **roles/compute.osLogin** or **roles/compute.osAdminLogin**.

**(2)Enable OS Login using SSH key:**

1. Generate SSH key using below command.

```
// Generate SSH key
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/hiroko-ssh -C hiroko -b 2048

// ssh-keygen saves your private key file to ~/.ssh/KEY_FILENAME and your public key file to ~/.ssh/KEY_FILENAME.pub.
hiroko@owners-MacBook-Pro ~ % cd .ssh
hiroko@owners-MacBook-Pro .ssh % ls
-rw-------   1 hiroko  staff  1856 Dec  9 22:00 hiroko-ssh     # my private key
-rw-r--r--   1 hiroko  staff   388 Dec  9 22:00 hiroko-ssh.pub # my public key
// View public ssh key
cat hiroko-ssh.pub
ssh-rsa AAAZHu+Sf3B3x0/2e6si3+IHbAlHIFEvNHrqtvPGE5rIuGL1Yf9OEcAJVNri2fdTj3YVn9ALWG887oJK9 hiroko
```

2. Go to Compute Engine -> Metadata. Then click on SSH KEYS tab. and add your public key.

**Question 2** You need to create a custom VPC with a single subnet. The subnet's range must be as large as possible. Which range should you use?

A: 0.0.0.0/0

B: 10.0.0.0/8

C: 172.16.0.0/12

D: 192.168.0.0/16

Answer: B

**Explanation**

- https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/vpc#restricted-ranges

**VPC (A Virtual Private Cloud)**

- VPC networks, including their associated routes and firewall rules.
- Subnets are regional resources.
- Each subnet defines a range of IPv4 addresses. Subnets in custom mode VPC networks can also have a range of IPv6 addresses.
- default, auto, custom
- When an auto mode VPC network is created, one subnet from each region is automatically created within it. These automatically created subnets use a set of predefined IPv4 ranges that fit within the 10.128.0.0/9 CIDR block.
- When a custom mode VPC network is created, no subnets are automatically created.

**Question 11**

You are creating a Kubernetes Engine cluster to deploy multiple pods inside the cluster. All container logs must be stored in BigQuery for later analysis. You want to follow Google-recommended practices. Which two approaches can you take?

A: Turn on Stackdriver Logging during the Kubernetes Engine cluster creation.

B: Turn on Stackdriver Monitoring during the Kubernetes Engine cluster creation.

C: Develop a custom add-on that uses Cloud Logging API and BigQuery API. Deploy the add-on to your Kubernetes Engine cluster.

D: Use the Stackdriver Logging export feature to create a sink to Cloud Storage. Create a Cloud Dataflow job that imports log files from Cloud Storage to BigQuery.

E: Use the Stackdriver Logging export feature to create a sink to BigQuery. Specify a filter expression to export log records related to your Kubernetes Engine cluster only.

Answer: A, E

**Explanation**
A Is correct because creating a cluster with Stackdriver Logging option will enable all the container logs to be stored in Stackdriver Logging.

B Is not correct because creating a cluster with Stackdriver Monitoring option will enable monitoring metrics to be gathered, but it has nothing to do with logging

C is not correct, because even if you can develop a Kubernetes addon that will send logs to BigQuery, this is not a Google-recommended practice.

D is incorrect because this is not a Google recommended practice.

E Is correct because Stackdriver Logging support exporting logs to BigQuery by creating sinks (documentation)

<hr />

**Question 12**

You need to create a new Kubernetes Cluster on Google Cloud Platform that can autoscale the number of worker nodes. What should you do?

A: Create a cluster on Kubernetes Engine and enable autoscaling on Kubernetes Engine.

B: Create a cluster on Kubernetes Engine and enable autoscaling on the instance group of the cluster.

C: Configure a Compute Engine instance as a worker and add it to an unmanaged instance group. Add a load balancer to the instance group and rely on the load balancer to create additional Compute Engine instances when needed.

D: Create Compute Engine instances for the workers and the master, and install Kubernetes. Rely on Kubernetes to create additional Compute Engine instances when needed.

Answer: A

**Explanation**
A is correct because this is the way to set up an autoscaling Kubernetes cluster.

B is not correct because you should not manage the scaling of Kubernetes through the MIG.

C is not correct because an UMIG cannot scale based on a load balancer and this is not the correct way to set up Kubernetes.

D is not correct because Kubernetes will not create additional instances when deployed on Compute Engine.

<hr />

**Question 13**

You have an application server running on Compute Engine in the europe-west1-d zone. You need to ensure high availability and replicate the server to the europe-west2-c zone using the fewest steps possible. What should you do?

A: Create a snapshot from the disk. Create a disk from the snapshot in the europe-west2-c zone. Create a new VM with that disk.

B: Create a snapshot from the disk. Create a disk from the snapshot in the europe-west1-d zone and then move the disk to europe-west2-c. Create a new VM with that disk.

C: Use "gcloud" to copy the disk to the europe-west2-c zone. Create a new VM with that disk.

D: Use "gcloud compute instances move" with parameter "--destination-zone europe-west2-c" to move the instance to the new zone.

Answer: A

**Explanation**
A is correct because this makes sure the VM gets replicated in the new zone.

B is not correct because this takes more steps than A.

C is not correct because this will generate an error, because gcloud cannot copy disks.

D is not correct because the original VM will be moved, not replicated.

**Question 16**

You created an update for your application on App Engine. You want to deploy the update without impacting your users. You want to be able to roll back as quickly as possible if it fails. What should you do?

A: Delete the current version of your application. Deploy the update using the same version identifier as the deleted version.

B: Notify your users of an upcoming maintenance window. Deploy the update in that maintenance window.

C: Deploy the update as the same version that is currently running.

D: Deploy the update as a new version. Migrate traffic from the current version to the new version.

Answer: D

**Explanation**
And B are not correct because this will make the application temporarily unavailable to users.

C is not correct because to roll back, you’ll need to redeploy the previous deployment because the app was overwritten with the same version number. Therefore this takes longer than a rollback using method D.

D is correct because this makes sure there is no downtime and you can roll back the fastest.

<hr />

**Question 17**

You have created a Kubernetes deployment, called Deployment-A, with 3 replicas on your cluster. Another deployment, called Deployment-B, needs access to Deployment-A. You cannot expose Deployment-A outside of the cluster. What should you do?

A: Create a Service of type NodePort for Deployment A and an Ingress Resource for that Service. Have Deployment B use the Ingress IP address.

B: Create a Service of type LoadBalancer for Deployment Have Deployment B use the Service IP address.

C: Create a Service of type LoadBalancer for Deployment A and an Ingress Resource for that Service. Have Deployment B use the Ingress IP address.

D: Create a Service of type ClusterIP for Deployment Have Deployment B use the Service IP address.

Answer: D

**Explanation**
A is not correct because this exposes Deployment A over the public internet.

B is not correct because LoadBalancer will expose the service publicly.

C is not correct because this exposes the service externally using a cloud provider’s load balancer, and Ingress can work only with nodeport, not clusterIP.

D is correct because this exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP address. Choosing this method makes the service reachable only from within the cluster.

You want to configure autohealing for network load balancing for a group of Compute Engine instances that run in multiple zones, using the fewest possible steps. You need to configure re-creation of VMs if they are unresponsive after 3 attempts of 10 seconds each. What should you do?

A: Create an HTTP load balancer with a backend configuration that references an existing instance group. Set the health check to healthy (HTTP)

B: Create an HTTP load balancer with a backend configuration that references an existing instance group. Define a balancing mode and set the maximum RPS to 10.

C: Create a managed instance group. Set the Autohealing health check to healthy (HTTP)

D: Create a managed instance group. Verify that the autoscaling setting is on.

Answer: C

- Autohealing lets you automatically restart apps that are compromised. It promptly detects failed instances and recreates them automatically, so clients can be served again. With autohealing, you no longer need to manually bring an app back to service after a failure.

**The app includes the following Compute Engine components:[1]**

- Health check: an HTTP health check policy used by the autohealer to detect failed VM instances.
- Firewall rules: Google Cloud firewall rules let you allow or deny traffic to your instances.
- Managed instance group: A group of instances running the same demo web service.
- Instance template: A template used to create each instance in the instance group.

**Question 30**

You are deploying an application to App Engine. You want the number of instances to scale based on request rate. You need at least 3 unoccupied instances at all times. Which scaling type should you use?

A: Manual Scaling with 3 instances.

B: Basic Scaling with min_instances set to 3.

C: Basic Scaling with max_instances set to 3.

D: Automatic Scaling with min_idle_instances set to 3.

Answer: D

**App Engine scaling types**

You specify the scaling type in your app's app.yaml.

- Automatic (default)
- Basic
- Manual

```
automatic_scaling:
  target_cpu_utilization: 0.65
  min_instances: 5
  max_instances: 100
  min_pending_latency: 30ms
  max_pending_latency: automatic
  max_concurrent_requests: 50
```

- For example, if App Engine calculates that 5 instances are necessary to serve traffic, and min_idle_instances is set to 2, App Engine will run 7 instances (5, calculated based on traffic, plus 2 additional per min_idle_instances)."[3]

- Automatic scaling creates instances based on request rate, response latencies, and other application metrics.

- Basic scaling creates instances when your application receives requests. Each instance will be shut down when the application becomes idle. Basic scaling is ideal for work that is intermittent

- Manual scaling specifies the number of instances that continuously run regardless of the load level.

**Question 33**

You have a Dockerfile that you need to deploy on Kubernetes Engine. What should you do?

A: Use kubectl app deploy <dockerfilename>.

B: Use gcloud app deploy <dockerfilename>.

C: Create a docker image from the Dockerfile and upload it to Container Registry. Create a Deployment YAML file to point to that image. Use kubectl to create the deployment with that file.

D: Create a docker image from the Dockerfile and upload it to Cloud Storage. Create a Deployment YAML file to point to that image. Use kubectl to create the deployment with that file.

Answer: C

**Hello App**

- Dockerfile
- main.go
- Dockerfile is used to build the Docker image for the application.

```
// 1. Download the hello-app source code and Dockerfile by running the following commands:

git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes-engine-samples
cd kubernetes-engine-samples/hello-app

// 2. Build and tag the Docker image for hello-app:
docker build -t us-cenral1-docker.pkg.dev/${PROJECT_ID}/hello-repo/hello-app:v1 .

// 3. Run the docker images command to verify that the build was successful:
docker images

// Output
REPOSITORY                                                 TAG     IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/hello-repo/hello-app    v1      25cfadb1bf28   10 seconds ago   54 MB
```

> C is correct.
> A can be eliminated because kubectl app \* is not a valid command
> B can be eliminated because gcloud app deploy deploys on app engine, not on kubernetes (also it still requires a config file pointing to the image).
> D is not correct, since you cannot deploy a container image directly from GCS

**Question 36**

You need to run an important query in BigQuery but expect it to return a lot of records. You want to find out how much it will cost to run the query. You are using on-demand pricing. What should you do?

A: Arrange to switch to Flat-Rate pricing for this query, then move back to on-demand.

B: Use the command line to run a dry run query to estimate the number of bytes read. Then convert that bytes estimate to dollars using the Pricing Calculator.

C: Use the command line to run a dry run query to estimate the number of bytes returned. Then convert that bytes estimate to dollars using the Pricing Calculator.

D: Run a select count (\*) to get an idea of how many records your query will look through. Then convert that number of rows to dollars using the Pricing Calculator.

Answer: B

**Estimate query costs by Console**

- When you enter a query in the Google Cloud console, the query validator verifies the query syntax and provides an estimate of the number of bytes read. You can use this estimate to calculate query cost in the Pricing Calculator.
  ![](images/36.png)

**Estimate query costs by bq command**

When you run a query in the bq command-line tool, you can use the --dry_run flag to estimate the number of bytes read.

```
bq query \
--use_legacy_sql=false \
--dry_run \
'SELECT
   COUNTRY,
   AIRPORT,
   IATA
 FROM
   `project_id`.dataset.airports
 LIMIT
   1000'

**Question 41**

You created an instance of SQL Server 2017 on Compute Engine to test features in the new version. You want to connect to this instance using the fewest number of steps. What should you do?

A: Install a RDP client on your desktop. Verify that a firewall rule for port 3389 exists.

B: Install a RDP client in your desktop. Set a Windows username and password in the GCP Console. Use the credentials to log in to the instance.

C: Set a Windows password in the GCP Console. Verify that a firewall rule for port 22 exists. Click the RDP button in the GCP Console and supply the credentials to log in.

D: Set a Windows username and password in the GCP Console. Verify that a firewall rule for port 3389 exists. Click the RDP button in the GCP Console, and supply the credentials to log in.

Answer: B (D is NOT correct so B is the answer.)

- I tested this on on Compute Engine today by deploying a new instance. D is not correct. When you click the RDP button, you are asked to install a client or use the Windows RDP client if you are running Windows. There is no option to enter credentials or get an RDP session through the web interface.

- If the VM instance has a public IP address and firewall rules permit RDP access, use an RDP client. For more information, see Microsoft Remote Desktop clients to connect to the Windows instance.[1]

**Question 45** You have a project for your App Engine application that serves a development environment. The required testing has succeeded and you want to create a new project to serve as your production environment. What should you do?

A: Use gcloud to create the new project, and then deploy your application to the new project.

B: Use gcloud to create the new project and to copy the deployed application to the new project.

C: Create a Deployment Manager configuration file that copies the current App Engine deployment into a new project.

D: Deploy your application again using gcloud and specify the project parameter with the new project name to create the new project.

Answer: A (A is correct)

> Correct is A.

- Option B is wrong as the option to use gcloud app cp does not exist.
- Option C is wrong as Deployment Manager does not copy the application, but allows you to specify all the resources needed for your application in a declarative format using yaml
- Option D is wrong as gcloud app deploy would not create a new project. The project should be created before usage

**Question 47** You need to set up permissions for a set of Compute Engine instances to enable them to write data into a particular Cloud Storage bucket. You want to follow Google-recommended practices. What should you do?

A: Create a service account with an access scope. Use the access scope "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.write_only".

B: Create a service account with an access scope. Use the access scope'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform'.

C: Create a service account and add it to the IAM role'storage.objectCreator' for that bucket.

D: Create a service account and add it to the IAM role'storage.objectAdmin' for that bucket.

Answer: A (or C)

- Storage Object Creator (roles/storage.objectCreator)
  > Allows users to create objects. Does not give permission to view, delete, or replace objects
- Storage Object Admin (roles/storage.objectAdmin)
  > Grants full control over objects, including listing, creating, viewing, and deleting objects
- As per as the least privileage recommended by google, C is the correct Option, A is incorrect because the scope doesnt exist. B incorrect because it will give him full of control
- [Cloud Storage - Scopes](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication#oauth-scopes)

**Question 48** You have sensitive data stored in three Cloud Storage buckets and have enabled data access logging. You want to verify activities for a particular user for these buckets, using the fewest possible steps. You need to verify the addition of metadata labels and which files have been viewed from those buckets. What should you do?

A: Using the GCP Console, filter the Activity log to view the information.

B: Using the GCP Console, filter the Stackdriver log to view the information.

C: View the bucket in the Storage section of the GCP Console.

D: Create a trace in Stackdriver to view the information.

Answer: B
https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/audit-logging

- B is correct. In this scenario, you need to select data access audit logs in Cloud Logging.
- Note the Stackdriver Logging is now named Cloud Logging.
- B is the right ans. Activity log is not for data access audit logs, use log explorer for this purpose
- Cloud Storage: When Cloud Storage usage logs are enabled, Cloud Storage writes usage data to the Cloud Storage bucket, which generates Data Access audit logs for the bucket. The generated Data Access audit log has its caller identity redacted.[1]
- Admin Activity, **Data access**, policy denied, System event
- Cloud Audit Logs features Admin Activity logs documenting administrative events, and Data Access logs record accesses to your cloud data by your users.[2]
