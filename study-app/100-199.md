You want to be notified if any of the developers are spending above $500 per month on their sandbox environment. What should you do?

A: Create a single budget for all projects and configure budget alerts on this budget.

B: Create a separate billing account per sandbox project and enable BigQuery billing exports. Create a Data Studio dashboard to plot the spending per billing account.

C: Create a budget per project and configure budget alerts on all of these budgets.

D: Create a single billing account for all sandbox projects and enable BigQuery billing exports. Create a Data Studio dashboard to plot the spending per project.

Answer: C

- is C, not A
  with A, i guess if you create a single budget for all projects, together they can easily beat the $500 mark and you need to know if "one deveoper' did it.
  so one budget per project is the solution.
- Key is anyone goes above $500 means it requires project level

**Question 183**
Your company has embraced a hybrid cloud strategy where some of the applications are deployed on Google Cloud. A Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnel connects your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in Google Cloud with your company's on-premises network. Multiple applications in Google Cloud need to connect to an on-premises database server, and you want to avoid having to change the IP configuration in all of your applications when the IP of the database changes.

What should you do?

A: Configure Cloud NAT for all subnets of your VPC to be used when egressing from the VM instances.

B: Create a private zone on Cloud DNS, and configure the applications with the DNS name.

C: Configure the IP of the database as custom metadata for each instance, and query the metadata server.

D: Query the Compute Engine internal DNS from the applications to retrieve the IP of the database.

Answer: D (Correct is B)

> Forwarding zones
> Cloud DNS forwarding zones let you configure target name servers for specific private zones. Using a forwarding zone is one way to implement outbound DNS forwarding from your VPC network.

> A Cloud DNS forwarding zone is a special type of Cloud DNS private zone. Instead of creating records within the zone, you specify a set of forwarding targets. Each forwarding target is an IP address of a DNS server, located in your VPC network, or in an on-premises network connected to your VPC network by Cloud VPN or Cloud Interconnect.

- A does not apply, that is to provide internet access to resources
- C, does not apply
- D, I don't get it

- Cloud DNS offers DNS forwarding zones and DNS server policies to allow lookups of DNS names between your on-premises and Google Cloud environment.[1]

B: Deploy the container on Cloud Run (fully managed), and set the minimum number of instances to zero.

C: Deploy the container on App Engine flexible environment with autoscaling, and set the value min_instances to zero in the app.yaml.

D: Deploy the container on App Engine flexible environment with manual scaling, and set the value instances to zero in the app.yaml.

Answer: C(Correct is B)

- I think that is B the correct answer, because Cloud Run can scale to 0:
  And App Engine Flexible can't scale to 0, the minimum instance number is 1:
- When a revision does not receive any traffic, by default it is scaled in to zero container instances.[1]
- No, minimum 1 instance[2]

**Question 187**
Your web application has been running successfully on Cloud Run for Anthos. You want to evaluate an updated version of the application with a specific percentage of your production users (canary deployment).

What should you do?

A: Create a new service with the new version of the application. Split traffic between this version and the version that is currently running.

B: Create a new revision with the new version of the application. Split traffic between this version and the version that is currently running.

C: Create a new service with the new version of the application. Add HTTP Load Balancer in front of both services.

D: Create a new revision with the new version of the application. Add HTTP Load Balancer in front of both revisions.

Answer: B

- Canary deployments are a method of releasing software to a subset of users or servers. The plan is to deliver the update to a small selection of servers first, test it, and then roll it out to the other servers.

So it's a Revision or new update or a new version, not a service.

- This document shows you how to implement a deployment pipeline for Cloud Run that implements progression of code from developer branches to production with automated canary testing and percentage-based traffic management. It is intended for platform administrators who are responsible for creating and managing CI/CD pipelines
