**Question 1** Every employee of your company has a Google account. Your operational team needs to manage a large number of instances on Compute Engine. Each member of this team needs only administrative access to the servers. Your security team wants to ensure that the deployment of credentials is operationally efficient and must be able to determine who accessed a given instance.

What should you do?

A: Generate a new SSH key pair. Give the private key to each member of your team. Configure the public key in the metadata of each instance.

B: Ask each member of the team to generate a new SSH key pair and to send you their public key. Use a configuration management tool to deploy those keys on each instance.

C: Ask each member of the team to generate a new SSH key pair and to add the public key to their Google account. Grant the "compute.osAdminLogin" role to the Google group corresponding to this team.

D: Generate a new SSH key pair. Give the private key to each member of your team. Configure the public key as a project-wide public SSH key in your Cloud Platform project and allow project-wide public SSH keys on each instance.

Answer: C

**There are two ways to enable OS login.**

**(1)Enable OS Login using Metadata:**

1. Go to Compute Engine -> Metadata and create key and value.

```
Key: enable-oslogin
Value: TRUE
```

2. Go to IAM and grant **roles/compute.osLogin** or **roles/compute.osAdminLogin**.

**(2)Enable OS Login using SSH key:**

1. Generate SSH key using below command.

```
// Generate SSH key
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/hiroko-ssh -C hiroko -b 2048

// ssh-keygen saves your private key file to ~/.ssh/KEY_FILENAME and your public key file to ~/.ssh/KEY_FILENAME.pub.
hiroko@owners-MacBook-Pro ~ % cd .ssh
hiroko@owners-MacBook-Pro .ssh % ls
-rw-------   1 hiroko  staff  1856 Dec  9 22:00 hiroko-ssh     # my private key
-rw-r--r--   1 hiroko  staff   388 Dec  9 22:00 hiroko-ssh.pub # my public key
// View public ssh key
cat hiroko-ssh.pub
ssh-rsa AAAZHu+Sf3B3x0/2e6si3+IHbAlHIFEvNHrqtvPGE5rIuGL1Yf9OEcAJVNri2fdTj3YVn9ALWG887oJK9 hiroko
```

2. Go to Compute Engine -> Metadata. Then click on SSH KEYS tab. and add your public key.

**Question 2** You need to create a custom VPC with a single subnet. The subnet's range must be as large as possible. Which range should you use?

A: 0.0.0.0/0

B: 10.0.0.0/8

C: 172.16.0.0/12

D: 192.168.0.0/16

Answer: B

**Explanation**

- https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/vpc#restricted-ranges

**VPC (A Virtual Private Cloud)**

- VPC networks, including their associated routes and firewall rules.
- Subnets are regional resources.
- Each subnet defines a range of IPv4 addresses. Subnets in custom mode VPC networks can also have a range of IPv6 addresses.
- default, auto, custom
- When an auto mode VPC network is created, one subnet from each region is automatically created within it. These automatically created subnets use a set of predefined IPv4 ranges that fit within the 10.128.0.0/9 CIDR block.
- When a custom mode VPC network is created, no subnets are automatically created.

**Question 6** Your project has all its Compute Engine resources in the europe-west1 region. You want to set europe-west1 as the default region for gcloud commands. What should you do?

A: Use Cloud Shell instead of the command line interface of your device. Launch Cloud Shell after you navigate to a resource in the europe-west1 region. The europe-west1 region will automatically become the default region.

B: Use "gcloud config set compute/region europe-west1" to set the default region for future gcloud commands.

C: Use "gcloud config set compute/zone europe-west1" to set the default region for future gcloud commands.

D: Create a VPN from on-premises to a subnet in europe-west1, and use that connection when executing gcloud commands.

Answer: B

**Explanation**

- A is not correct because Cloud Shell will not default to the location that it’s launched from.
- B is correct because this will ensure that the relevant region is used when not overwritten by a command parameter.
- C is not correct because this command should be used to set a zone, not a region.
- D is not correct because a VPN to a specific subnet does not have any effect on the gcloud command region.

**Question 8**

Your company processes high volumes of IoT data that are time-stamped. The total data volume can be several petabytes. The data needs to be written and changed at a high speed. You want to use the most performant storage option for your data. Which product should you use?

A: Cloud Datastore

B: Cloud Storage

C: Cloud Bigtable

D: BigQuery

Answer: C

**Explanation**
A is not correct because Cloud Bigtable is more performant in frequent writes, and lookup is based on timestamp key.

B is not correct because Cloud Storage stores blobs, which cannot be queried.

C is correct because Cloud Bigtable is the most performant storage option to work with IoT and time series data.

D is not correct because although it can store the data, BigQuery is very slow at changing data.

<hr />

**Question 9**

Your application has a large international audience and runs stateless virtual machines within a managed instance group across multiple locations. One feature of the application lets users upload files and share them with other users. Files must be available for 30 days; after that, they are removed from the system entirely. Which storage solution should you choose?

A: A Cloud Datastore database.

B: A multi-regional Cloud Storage bucket.

C: Persistent SSD on virtual machine instances.

D: A managed instance group of Filestore servers.

Answer: B

**Explanation**
A is not correct because a Datastore database is not designed for file storage

B is correct because buckets can be multi-regional and have lifecycle management

C is not correct because disks are generally ephemeral for virtual machines in managed instance groups

D is not correct because content would be restricted to a single region for all international users

<hr />

**Question 10**

You have a definition for an instance template that contains a web application. You are asked to deploy the application so that it can scale based on the HTTP traffic it receives. What should you do?

A: Create a VM from the instance template. Create a custom image from the VM’s disk. Export the image to Cloud Storage. Create an HTTP load balancer and add the Cloud Storage bucket as its backend service.

B: Create a VM from the instance template. Create an App Engine application in Automatic Scaling mode that forwards all traffic to the VM.

C: Create a managed instance group based on the instance template. Configure autoscaling based on HTTP traffic and configure the instance group as the backend service of an HTTP load balancer.

D: Create the necessary amount of instances required for peak user traffic based on the instance template. Create an unmanaged instance group and add the instances to that instance group. Configure the instance group as the Backend Service of an HTTP load balancer.

Answer: C is correct because a managed instance group can use an instance template to scale based on HTTP traffic.

**Question 11**

You are creating a Kubernetes Engine cluster to deploy multiple pods inside the cluster. All container logs must be stored in BigQuery for later analysis. You want to follow Google-recommended practices. Which two approaches can you take?

A: Turn on Stackdriver Logging during the Kubernetes Engine cluster creation.

B: Turn on Stackdriver Monitoring during the Kubernetes Engine cluster creation.

C: Develop a custom add-on that uses Cloud Logging API and BigQuery API. Deploy the add-on to your Kubernetes Engine cluster.

D: Use the Stackdriver Logging export feature to create a sink to Cloud Storage. Create a Cloud Dataflow job that imports log files from Cloud Storage to BigQuery.

E: Use the Stackdriver Logging export feature to create a sink to BigQuery. Specify a filter expression to export log records related to your Kubernetes Engine cluster only.

Answer: A, E

**Explanation**
A Is correct because creating a cluster with Stackdriver Logging option will enable all the container logs to be stored in Stackdriver Logging.

B Is not correct because creating a cluster with Stackdriver Monitoring option will enable monitoring metrics to be gathered, but it has nothing to do with logging

C is not correct, because even if you can develop a Kubernetes addon that will send logs to BigQuery, this is not a Google-recommended practice.

D is incorrect because this is not a Google recommended practice.

E Is correct because Stackdriver Logging support exporting logs to BigQuery by creating sinks (documentation)

<hr />

**Question 12**

You need to create a new Kubernetes Cluster on Google Cloud Platform that can autoscale the number of worker nodes. What should you do?

A: Create a cluster on Kubernetes Engine and enable autoscaling on Kubernetes Engine.

B: Create a cluster on Kubernetes Engine and enable autoscaling on the instance group of the cluster.

C: Configure a Compute Engine instance as a worker and add it to an unmanaged instance group. Add a load balancer to the instance group and rely on the load balancer to create additional Compute Engine instances when needed.

D: Create Compute Engine instances for the workers and the master, and install Kubernetes. Rely on Kubernetes to create additional Compute Engine instances when needed.

Answer: A

**Explanation**
A is correct because this is the way to set up an autoscaling Kubernetes cluster.

B is not correct because you should not manage the scaling of Kubernetes through the MIG.

C is not correct because an UMIG cannot scale based on a load balancer and this is not the correct way to set up Kubernetes.

D is not correct because Kubernetes will not create additional instances when deployed on Compute Engine.

<hr />

**Question 13**

You have an application server running on Compute Engine in the europe-west1-d zone. You need to ensure high availability and replicate the server to the europe-west2-c zone using the fewest steps possible. What should you do?

A: Create a snapshot from the disk. Create a disk from the snapshot in the europe-west2-c zone. Create a new VM with that disk.

B: Create a snapshot from the disk. Create a disk from the snapshot in the europe-west1-d zone and then move the disk to europe-west2-c. Create a new VM with that disk.

C: Use "gcloud" to copy the disk to the europe-west2-c zone. Create a new VM with that disk.

D: Use "gcloud compute instances move" with parameter "--destination-zone europe-west2-c" to move the instance to the new zone.

Answer: A

**Explanation**
A is correct because this makes sure the VM gets replicated in the new zone.

B is not correct because this takes more steps than A.

C is not correct because this will generate an error, because gcloud cannot copy disks.

D is not correct because the original VM will be moved, not replicated.

**Question 16**

You created an update for your application on App Engine. You want to deploy the update without impacting your users. You want to be able to roll back as quickly as possible if it fails. What should you do?

A: Delete the current version of your application. Deploy the update using the same version identifier as the deleted version.

B: Notify your users of an upcoming maintenance window. Deploy the update in that maintenance window.

C: Deploy the update as the same version that is currently running.

D: Deploy the update as a new version. Migrate traffic from the current version to the new version.

Answer: D

**Explanation**
And B are not correct because this will make the application temporarily unavailable to users.

C is not correct because to roll back, you’ll need to redeploy the previous deployment because the app was overwritten with the same version number. Therefore this takes longer than a rollback using method D.

D is correct because this makes sure there is no downtime and you can roll back the fastest.

<hr />

**Question 17**

You have created a Kubernetes deployment, called Deployment-A, with 3 replicas on your cluster. Another deployment, called Deployment-B, needs access to Deployment-A. You cannot expose Deployment-A outside of the cluster. What should you do?

A: Create a Service of type NodePort for Deployment A and an Ingress Resource for that Service. Have Deployment B use the Ingress IP address.

B: Create a Service of type LoadBalancer for Deployment Have Deployment B use the Service IP address.

C: Create a Service of type LoadBalancer for Deployment A and an Ingress Resource for that Service. Have Deployment B use the Ingress IP address.

D: Create a Service of type ClusterIP for Deployment Have Deployment B use the Service IP address.

Answer: D

**Explanation**
A is not correct because this exposes Deployment A over the public internet.

B is not correct because LoadBalancer will expose the service publicly.

C is not correct because this exposes the service externally using a cloud provider’s load balancer, and Ingress can work only with nodeport, not clusterIP.

D is correct because this exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP address. Choosing this method makes the service reachable only from within the cluster.

B: In the Google Cloud Platform Console, go to the IAM page for your project and apply the filter "Role:Owner".

C: Use "gcloud iam list-grantable-role --project my-project" from your Terminal.

D: Use "gcloud iam list-grantable-role" from Cloud Shell on the project page.

Answer: B

**Explanation**
A is not correct because it will give the org-wide owners, but you are interested in the project owners, which could be different.

B is correct because this shows you the Owners of the project.

C is not correct because this command is to list grantable roles for a resource, but does not return who has a specific role.

D is not correct because this command is to list grantable roles for a resource, but does not return who has a specific role.

<hr />

**Question 20**

You want to create a new role for your colleagues that will apply to all current and future projects created in your organization. The role should have the permissions of the BigQuery Job User and Cloud Bigtable User roles. You want to follow Google’s recommended practices. How should you create the new role?

A: Use "gcloud iam combine-roles --global" to combine the 2 roles into a new custom role.

B: For one of your projects, in the Google Cloud Platform Console under Roles, select both roles and combine them into a new custom role. Use "gcloud iam promote-role" to promote the role from a project role to an organization role.

C: For all projects, in the Google Cloud Platform Console under Roles, select both roles and combine them into a new custom role.

D: For your organization, in the Google Cloud Platform Console under Roles, select both roles and combine them into a new custom role.

Answer: D

**Explanation**

- A is not correct because this does not create a new role.
- B is not correct because gcloud cannot promote a role to org level.
- C is not correct because it’s recommended to define the role on the organization level. Also, the role will not be applied on new projects.
- D is correct because this creates a new role with the combined permissions on the organization level.

You want to select and configure a cost-effective solution for relational data on Google Cloud Platform. You are working with a small set of operational data in one geographic location. You need to support point-in-time recovery. What should you do?

A: Select Cloud SQL (MySQL). Verify that the enable binary logging option is selected.

B: Select Cloud SQL (MySQL). Select the create failover replicas option.

C: Select Cloud Spanner. Set up your instance with 2 nodes.

D: Select Cloud Spanner. Set up your instance as multi-regional.

Answer: A

- Point-in-time recovery is enabled by default when you create a new Cloud SQL instance.[1][2]
- Point-in-time recovery uses binary logs. These logs update regularly and use storage space.[3]
- In the event of an instance or zone failure, the standby instance becomes the new primary instance. Users are then rerouted to the new primary instance. This process is called a failover [4]
- fail-over 障害迂回

**Question 25**

You want to configure autohealing for network load balancing for a group of Compute Engine instances that run in multiple zones, using the fewest possible steps. You need to configure re-creation of VMs if they are unresponsive after 3 attempts of 10 seconds each. What should you do?

A: Create an HTTP load balancer with a backend configuration that references an existing instance group. Set the health check to healthy (HTTP)

B: Create an HTTP load balancer with a backend configuration that references an existing instance group. Define a balancing mode and set the maximum RPS to 10.

C: Create a managed instance group. Set the Autohealing health check to healthy (HTTP)

D: Create a managed instance group. Verify that the autoscaling setting is on.

Answer: C

- Option C is correct because creating a managed instance group allows you to use autohealing to automatically recreate VMs that are unresponsive after 3 attempts of 10 seconds each. You can set the Autohealing health check to healthy (HTTP) to specify the health check that determines whether the instances are considered healthy or not. If an instance becomes unresponsive, Autohealing will recreate the instance and attach it to the managed instance group.

- Pro Tip: Use separate health checks for load balancing and for autohealing. Health checks for load balancing detect unresponsive instances and direct traffic away from them. Health checks for autohealing detect and recreate failed instances, so they should be less aggressive than load balancing health checks. Using the same health check for these services would remove the distinction between unresponsive instances and failed instances, causing unnecessary latency and unavailability for your users.

**Question 28**

Several employees at your company have been creating projects with Cloud Platform and paying for it with their personal credit cards, which the company reimburses. The company wants to centralize all these projects under a single, new billing account. What should you do?

A: Contact cloud-billing@google.com with your bank account details and request a corporate billing account for your company.

B: Create a ticket with Google Support and wait for their call to share your credit card details over the phone.

C: In the Google Platform Console, go to the Resource Manage and move all projects to the root Organizarion.

D: In the Google Cloud Platform Console, create a new billing account and set up a payment method.

Answer: C

- C is incomplete. Moving projects under an organisation doesn't change their linked billing project.
  https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/migrating-projects-billing

- Note: The link between projects and billing accounts is preserved, irrespective of the hierarchy. When you move your existing projects into the organization they will continue to work and be billed as they used to before the migration, even if the corresponding billing account has not been migrated yet.

- D is incomplete as well, after setting the billing account in the organisation you need to link the projects to the new billing account.

**Question 30**

You are deploying an application to App Engine. You want the number of instances to scale based on request rate. You need at least 3 unoccupied instances at all times. Which scaling type should you use?

A: Manual Scaling with 3 instances.

B: Basic Scaling with min_instances set to 3.

C: Basic Scaling with max_instances set to 3.

D: Automatic Scaling with min_idle_instances set to 3.

Answer: D

**App Engine scaling types**

You specify the scaling type in your app's app.yaml.

- Automatic (default)
- Basic
- Manual

```
automatic_scaling:
  target_cpu_utilization: 0.65
  min_instances: 5
  max_instances: 100
  min_pending_latency: 30ms
  max_pending_latency: automatic
  max_concurrent_requests: 50
```

- For example, if App Engine calculates that 5 instances are necessary to serve traffic, and min_idle_instances is set to 2, App Engine will run 7 instances (5, calculated based on traffic, plus 2 additional per min_idle_instances)."[3]

- Automatic scaling creates instances based on request rate, response latencies, and other application metrics.

- Basic scaling creates instances when your application receives requests. Each instance will be shut down when the application becomes idle. Basic scaling is ideal for work that is intermittent

- Manual scaling specifies the number of instances that continuously run regardless of the load level.

**Question 31**

You have a development project with appropriate IAM roles defined. You are creating a production project and want to have the same IAM roles on the new project, using the fewest possible steps. What should you do?

A: Use gcloud iam roles copy and specify the production project as the destination project.

B: Use gcloud iam roles copy and specify your organization as the destination organization.

C: In the Google Cloud Platform Console, use the'create role from role' functionality.

D: In the Google Cloud Platform Console, use the'create role' functionality and select all applicable permissions.

Answer: A

- The correct answer is Option A.

- To create the same IAM roles in a production project as in a development project, using the fewest possible steps, you can use the gcloud iam roles copy command and specify the production project as the destination project.

- The `gcloud iam roles copy` command allows you to copy IAM roles between projects or organizations. By specifying the production project as the destination project, you can copy the IAM roles from the development project to the production project.

- Option B is incorrect because specifying your organization as the destination organization will copy the IAM roles to all projects within the organization, which is not what you want.

```
//To create a copy of an existing role spanner.databaseAdmin into a project with PROJECT_ID, run:
gcloud iam roles copy --source="roles/spanner.databaseAdmin" --destination=CustomSpannerDbAdmin --dest-project=PROJECT_ID

**Question 33**

You have a Dockerfile that you need to deploy on Kubernetes Engine. What should you do?

A: Use kubectl app deploy <dockerfilename>.

B: Use gcloud app deploy <dockerfilename>.

C: Create a docker image from the Dockerfile and upload it to Container Registry. Create a Deployment YAML file to point to that image. Use kubectl to create the deployment with that file.

D: Create a docker image from the Dockerfile and upload it to Cloud Storage. Create a Deployment YAML file to point to that image. Use kubectl to create the deployment with that file.

Answer: C

**Hello App**

- Dockerfile
- main.go
- Dockerfile is used to build the Docker image for the application.

```
// 1. Download the hello-app source code and Dockerfile by running the following commands:

git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes-engine-samples
cd kubernetes-engine-samples/hello-app

// 2. Build and tag the Docker image for hello-app:
docker build -t us-cenral1-docker.pkg.dev/${PROJECT_ID}/hello-repo/hello-app:v1 .

// 3. Run the docker images command to verify that the build was successful:
docker images

// Output
REPOSITORY                                                 TAG     IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/hello-repo/hello-app    v1      25cfadb1bf28   10 seconds ago   54 MB
```

> C is correct.
> A can be eliminated because kubectl app \* is not a valid command
> B can be eliminated because gcloud app deploy deploys on app engine, not on kubernetes (also it still requires a config file pointing to the image).
> D is not correct, since you cannot deploy a container image directly from GCS

You need to run an important query in BigQuery but expect it to return a lot of records. You want to find out how much it will cost to run the query. You are using on-demand pricing. What should you do?

A: Arrange to switch to Flat-Rate pricing for this query, then move back to on-demand.

B: Use the command line to run a dry run query to estimate the number of bytes read. Then convert that bytes estimate to dollars using the Pricing Calculator.

C: Use the command line to run a dry run query to estimate the number of bytes returned. Then convert that bytes estimate to dollars using the Pricing Calculator.

D: Run a select count (\*) to get an idea of how many records your query will look through. Then convert that number of rows to dollars using the Pricing Calculator.

Answer: B

**Estimate query costs by Console**

- When you enter a query in the Google Cloud console, the query validator verifies the query syntax and provides an estimate of the number of bytes read. You can use this estimate to calculate query cost in the Pricing Calculator.
  ![](images/36.png)

**Estimate query costs by bq command**

When you run a query in the bq command-line tool, you can use the --dry_run flag to estimate the number of bytes read.

**Question 41**

You created an instance of SQL Server 2017 on Compute Engine to test features in the new version. You want to connect to this instance using the fewest number of steps. What should you do?

A: Install a RDP client on your desktop. Verify that a firewall rule for port 3389 exists.

B: Install a RDP client in your desktop. Set a Windows username and password in the GCP Console. Use the credentials to log in to the instance.

C: Set a Windows password in the GCP Console. Verify that a firewall rule for port 22 exists. Click the RDP button in the GCP Console and supply the credentials to log in.

D: Set a Windows username and password in the GCP Console. Verify that a firewall rule for port 3389 exists. Click the RDP button in the GCP Console, and supply the credentials to log in.

Answer: B (D is NOT correct so B is the answer.)

- I tested this on on Compute Engine today by deploying a new instance. D is not correct. When you click the RDP button, you are asked to install a client or use the Windows RDP client if you are running Windows. There is no option to enter credentials or get an RDP session through the web interface.

- If the VM instance has a public IP address and firewall rules permit RDP access, use an RDP client. For more information, see Microsoft Remote Desktop clients to connect to the Windows instance.[1]

**Question 51**: You are creating a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster with a cluster autoscaler feature enabled. You need to make sure that each node of the cluster will run a monitoring pod that sends container metrics to a third-party monitoring solution. What should you do?

A: Deploy the monitoring pod in a StatefulSet object.

B: Deploy the monitoring pod in a DaemonSet object.

C: Reference the monitoring pod in a Deployment object.

D: Reference the monitoring pod in a cluster initializer at the GKE cluster creation time.

Answer: B

- Kubernetes has several ways to deploy applications, including **deployments**, **DaemonSets** and **StatefulSets**. But each resource type has unique benefits, drawbacks and use cases.
- Like deployments, DaemonSets are files. T
  ```
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: DaemonSet
  metadata:
  name: fluentd-elasticsearch
  namespace: kube-system
  labels:
     k8s-app: fluentd-logging
  ```
- DaemonSets are most often used to run background software, such as a **monitoring agent**, on each node in a cluster. DaemonSets are **not typically used to deploy the main apps** hosted on Kubernetes.

You have one project called proj-sa where you manage all your service accounts. You want to be able to use a service account from this project to take snapshots of VMs running in another project called proj-vm. What should you do?

A: Download the private key from the service account, and add it to each VMs custom metadata.

B: Download the private key from the service account, and add the private key to each VM's SSH keys.

C: Grant the service account the IAM Role of Compute Storage Admin in the project called proj-vm.

D: When creating the VMs, set the service account's API scope for Compute Engine to read/write.

Answer: C

C is the correct answer.
It took me a while to figure it out because I didn't understand how service accounts work across project. This article made it clear for me. https://gtseres.medium.com/using-service-accounts-across-projects-in-gcp-cf9473fef8f0

You create the service account in proj-sa and take note of the service account email, then you go to proj-vm in IAM > ADD and add the service account's email as new member and give it the Compute Storage Admin role.

**Question 64**
You are running an application on multiple virtual machines within a managed instance group and have autoscaling enabled. The autoscaling policy is configured so that additional instances are added to the group if the CPU utilization of instances goes above 80%. VMs are added until the instance group reaches its maximum limit of five VMs or until CPU utilization of instances lowers to 80%. The initial delay for HTTP health checks against the instances is set to 30 seconds.

The virtual machine instances take around three minutes to become available for users. You observe that when the instance group autoscales, it adds more instances then necessary to support the levels of end-user traffic. You want to properly maintain instance group sizes when autoscaling. What should you do?

A: Set the maximum number of instances to 1.

B: Decrease the maximum number of instances to 3.

C: Use a TCP health check instead of an HTTP health check.

D: Increase the initial delay of the HTTP health check to 200 seconds.

Answer: D

- D is correct. The reason is that when you do health check, you want the VM to be working. Do the first check after initial setup time of 3 mins = 180 s < 200 s is reasonable.

**MIGs**

- (MIGs) maintain high availability of your applications by proactively keeping your virtual machine (VM) instances available,
- If a managed instance stops running, but the change of state was not initiated by the MIG, then the MIG automatically recreates that instance.
- Changes of instance state that are not initiated by the MIG include:
  1. Hardware failures.
  2. Infrastructure maintenance events when the VM instance is not set to live migrate.

**Autohealing behavior**
Autohealing doesn't recreate a VM during that VM's initialization period. For more information, see the autoHealingPolicies[].initialDelaySec property.

**Question 65**
You need to select and configure compute resources for a set of batch processing jobs. These jobs take around 2 hours to complete and are run nightly. You want to minimize service costs. What should you do?

A: Select Google Kubernetes Engine. Use a single-node cluster with a small instance type.

B: Select Google Kubernetes Engine. Use a three-node cluster with micro instance types.

C: Select Compute Engine. Use preemptible VM instances of the appropriate standard machine type.

D: Select Compute Engine. Use VM instance types that support micro bursting.

Answer: C

> - preemptible VMs can only run for up to 24 hours at a time,
> - Preemptible VM instances are available at much lower price—a 60-91% discount—compared to the price of standard VMs.

**Question 66**
You recently deployed a new version of an application to App Engine and then discovered a bug in the release. You need to immediately revert to the prior version of the application. What should you do?

A: Run gcloud app restore.

B: On the App Engine page of the GCP Console, select the application that needs to be reverted and click Revert.

C: On the App Engine Versions page of the GCP Console, route 100% of the traffic to the previous version.

D: Deploy the original version as a separate application. Then go to App Engine settings and split traffic between applications so that the original version serves 100% of the requests.

Answer: D (the correct is C)

- correct is C NOT D.
  Option A is wrong as gcloud app restore was used for backup and restore and has been deprecated.Option B is wrong as there is no application revert functionality available.Option D is wrong as App Engine maintains version and need not be redeployed.

- D - is wrong because there is only one app engine per project. C is correct, you have to split traffic

- Correct option is C. AppEngine already creates a version for you. Also you do not create a application as one project is associated with one AppEngine application.

**Question 67**
You deployed an App Engine application using gcloud app deploy, but it did not deploy to the intended project. You want to find out why this happened and where the application deployed. What should you do?

A: Check the app.yaml file for your application and check project settings.

B: Check the web-application.xml file for your application and check project settings.

C: Go to Deployment Manager and review settings for deployment of applications.

D: Go to Cloud Shell and run gcloud config list to review the Google Cloud configuration used for deployment.

Answer: D

- I would opt option D : as it would help to check the config details and Option A is not correct, as app.yaml would have only the runtime and script to run parameters and not the Project details

- The web.xml file is only used when deploying a Java app to a runtime that includes the Eclipse Jetty 9/ servlet 3 server.

**app.yaml**

- You configure your App Engine app's settings in the app.yaml file. This file specifies how URL paths correspond to request handlers and static files. The app.yaml file also contains information about your app's code, such as the runtime and the latest version identifier.[1]

```
runtime: python27
api_version: 1
threadsafe: true

handlers:
- url: /
  script: home.app

- url: /index\.html
  script: home.app

- url: /stylesheets
  static_dir: stylesheets

- url: /(.*\.(gif|png|jpg))$
  static_files: static/\1
  upload: static/.*\.(gif|png|jpg)$

- url: /admin/.*
  script: admin.app
  login: admin

- url: /.*
  script: not_found.app
```

**web.xml**

- Java web applications use a deployment descriptor file to determine how URLs map to servlets, which URLs require authentication, and other information.[2]

**appengine-web.xml**

- In addition to the web.xml deployment descriptor, App Engine Java applications use a configuration file, named appengine-web.xml,[3]

**Question 68**
You want to configure 10 Compute Engine instances for availability when maintenance occurs. Your requirements state that these instances should attempt to automatically restart if they crash. Also, the instances should be highly available including during system maintenance. What should you do?

A: Create an instance template for the instances. Set the'Automatic Restart' to on. Set the'On-host maintenance' to Migrate VM instance. Add the instance template to an instance group.

B: Create an instance template for the instances. Set'Automatic Restart' to off. Set'On-host maintenance' to Terminate VM instances. Add the instance template to an instance group.

C: Create an instance group for the instances. Set the'Autohealing' health check to healthy (HTTP).

D: Create an instance group for the instance. Verify that the'Advanced creation options' setting for'do not retry machine creation' is set to off.

Answer: A

**Set host maintenance policy of a VM**

- **onHostMaintenance**: determines the behavior when a maintenance event occurs that might cause your VM to reboot.

  1. MIGRATE: causes Compute Engine to live migrate an instance when there is a maintenance event. This is the default value.
  2. TERMINATE: stops a VM instead of migrating it.

- **automaticRestart**: determines the behavior when a VM crashes or is stopped by the system.

**Question 70**
You have a virtual machine that is currently configured with 2 vCPUs and 4 GB of memory. It is running out of memory. You want to upgrade the virtual machine to have 8 GB of memory. What should you do?

A: Rely on live migration to move the workload to a machine with more memory.

B: Use gcloud to add metadata to the VM. Set the key to required-memory-size and the value to 8 GB.

C: Stop the VM, change the machine type to n1-standard-8, and start the VM.

D: Stop the VM, increase the memory to 8 GB, and start the VM.

Answer: D

- D is correct. If you pay attention to the question, option C mentions n1-standard-8. That instance type has **8vCPUs** and 30 GB RAM, and we only need 8GB. On top of that, it is possible to use custom machine type to adjust current VM RAM to the value we need.

**Question 84**
You are hosting an application on bare-metal servers in your own data center. The application needs access to Cloud Storage. However, security policies prevent the servers hosting the application from having public IP addresses or access to the internet. You want to follow Google-recommended practices to provide the application with access to Cloud Storage. What should you do?

A: 1. Use nslookup to get the IP address for storage.googleapis.com. 2. Negotiate with the security team to be able to give a public IP address to the servers. 3. Only allow egress traffic from those servers to the IP addresses for storage.googleapis.com.

B: 1. Using Cloud VPN, create a VPN tunnel to a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in Google Cloud. 2. In this VPC, create a Compute Engine instance and install the Squid proxy server on this instance. 3. Configure your servers to use that instance as a proxy to access Cloud Storage.

C: 1. Use Migrate for Compute Engine (formerly known as Velostrata) to migrate those servers to Compute Engine. 2. Create an internal load balancer (ILB) that uses storage.googleapis.com as backend. 3. Configure your new instances to use this ILB as proxy.

D: 1. Using Cloud VPN or Interconnect, create a tunnel to a VPC in Google Cloud. 2. Use Cloud Router to create a custom route advertisement for 199.36.153.4/30. Announce that network to your on-premises network through the VPN tunnel. 3. In your on-premises network, configure your DNS server to resolve \*.googleapis.com as a CNAME to restricted.googleapis.com.

Answer: D

- D VPN/interconnect without exposing to public
- Private Google Access for on-premises hosts provides a way for on-premises systems to connect to Google APIs and services by routing traffic through a Cloud VPN tunnel or a VLAN attachment for Cloud Interconnect. Private Google Access for on-premises hosts is an alternative to connecting to Google APIs and services over the internet.

- Let me walk through an example of Cloud VPN. This diagram shows a simple VPN connection between your VPC and on-premises network. Your VPC network has subnets in us-east1 and us-west1, with GCP resources in each of those regions. These resources are able to communicate using their **internal IP addresses** because routing within a network is automatically configured

**Question 91**
You are building an application that will run in your data center. The application will use Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services like AutoML. You created a service account that has appropriate access to AutoML. You need to enable authentication to the APIs from your on-premises environment. What should you do?

A: Use service account credentials in your on-premises application.

B: Use gcloud to create a key file for the service account that has appropriate permissions.

C: Set up direct interconnect between your data center and Google Cloud Platform to enable authentication for your on-premises applications.

D: Go to the IAM & admin console, grant a user account permissions similar to the service account permissions, and use this user account for authentication from your data center.

Answer: B

- To use a service account outside of Google Cloud, such as on other platforms or on-premises, you must first establish the identity of the service account. Public/private key pairs provide a secure way of accomplishing this goal.

**Console**

**Question 93**
You deployed a new application inside your Google Kubernetes Engine cluster using the YAML file specified below.

![](images/93-1.png)

You check the status of the deployed pods and notice that one of them is still in PENDING status:

![](images/93-2.png)

You want to find out why the pod is stuck in pending status. What should you do?

A: Review details of the myapp-service Service object and check for error messages.

B: Review details of the myapp-deployment Deployment object and check for error messages.

C: Review details of myapp-deployment-58ddbbb995-lp86m Pod and check for warning messages.

D: View logs of the container in myapp-deployment-58ddbbb995-lp86m pod and check for warning messages.

Answer: C

**Debugging Pods**

The first step in debugging a Pod is taking a look at it. Check the current state of the Pod and recent events with the following command:

```
kubectl describe pods ${POD_NAME}
```

**My pod stays pending**

- If a Pod is stuck in Pending it means that it can not be scheduled onto a node. Generally this is because there are insufficient resources of one type or another that prevent scheduling. Look at the output of the **kubectl describe** ... command above. There should be **messages** from the scheduler about why it can not schedule your pod. Reasons include:

- You don't have enough resources:[2]
- You are using hostPort:[2]

You want to configure an SSH connection to a single Compute Engine instance for users in the dev1 group. This instance is the only resource in this particular Google Cloud Platform project that the dev1 users should be able to connect to. What should you do?

A: Set metadata to enable-oslogin=true for the instance. Grant the dev1 group the compute.osLogin role. Direct them to use the Cloud Shell to ssh to that instance.

B: Set metadata to enable-oslogin=true for the instance. Set the service account to no service account for that instance. Direct them to use the Cloud Shell to ssh to that instance.

C: Enable block project wide keys for the instance. Generate an SSH key for each user in the dev1 group. Distribute the keys to dev1 users and direct them to use their third-party tools to connect.

D: Enable block project wide keys for the instance. Generate an SSH key and associate the key with that instance. Distribute the key to dev1 users and direct them to use their third-party tools to connect.

Answer: A

```

gcloud compute instances create VM_NAME \
 --image-family=IMAGE_FAMILY \
 --image-project=IMAGE_PROJECT \
 --metadata enable-oslogin=TRUE

```

- OS Login enables you to control access to virtual machine (VM) instances based on IAM permissions.[1]

- IAM-based access (OS Login)
  This restricts VM access to users with the Compute OS Login or Compute OS Admin Login role (roles/compute.osLogin, roles/compute.osAdminLogin), or predefined or custom roles with permissions to enable IAM-based access. You assign the role in the IAM & Admin section, IAM page.

**Question 99**
You are using Google Kubernetes Engine with autoscaling enabled to host a new application. You want to expose this new application to the public, using HTTPS on a public IP address. What should you do?

A: Create a Kubernetes Service of type NodePort for your application, and a Kubernetes Ingress to expose this Service via a Cloud Load Balancer.

B: Create a Kubernetes Service of type ClusterIP for your application. Configure the public DNS name of your application using the IP of this Service.

C: Create a Kubernetes Service of type NodePort to expose the application on port 443 of each node of the Kubernetes cluster. Configure the public DNS name of your application with the IP of every node of the cluster to achieve load-balancing.

D: Create a HAProxy pod in the cluster to load-balance the traffic to all the pods of the application. Forward the public traffic to HAProxy with an iptable rule. Configure the DNS name of your application using the public IP of the node HAProxy is running on.

Answer: A

```

// 1. Create a container cluster
gcloud container clusters create loadbalancedcluster

// 2.Deploying a web application
// load-balancing/web-deployment.yaml
// Apply the resource to the cluster:
kubectl apply -f web-deployment.yaml

// 3. Exposing your Deployment inside your cluster
// load-balancing/web-service.yaml
kubectl apply -f web-service.yaml
NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE
web NodePort 10.35.245.219 <none> 8080:32640/TCP 5m

//---
In the sample output, the node port for the web Service is 32640. Also, note that there is no external IP allocated for this Service. Since the GKE nodes are not externally accessible by default, creating this Service does not make your application accessible from the internet.

//---
To make your HTTP(S) web server application publicly accessible, you must create an Ingress resource.

// 4. Creating an Ingress resource
// load-balancing/basic-ingress.yaml
// Apply the resource to the cluster:
kubectl apply -f basic-ingress.yaml

// 5. Visiting your application

kubectl get ingress basic-ingress
NAME HOSTS ADDRESS PORTS AGE
basic-ingress \* 203.0.113.12 80 2m

```

**ClusterIp exposure < NodePort exposure < LoadBalancer exposure**
