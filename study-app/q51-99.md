**Question 51**: You are creating a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster with a cluster autoscaler feature enabled. You need to make sure that each node of the cluster will run a monitoring pod that sends container metrics to a third-party monitoring solution. What should you do?

A: Deploy the monitoring pod in a StatefulSet object.

B: Deploy the monitoring pod in a DaemonSet object.

C: Reference the monitoring pod in a Deployment object.

D: Reference the monitoring pod in a cluster initializer at the GKE cluster creation time.

Answer: B

- Kubernetes has several ways to deploy applications, including **deployments**, **DaemonSets** and **StatefulSets**. But each resource type has unique benefits, drawbacks and use cases.
- Like deployments, DaemonSets are files. T
  ```
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: DaemonSet
  metadata:
  name: fluentd-elasticsearch
  namespace: kube-system
  labels:
     k8s-app: fluentd-logging
  ```
- DaemonSets are most often used to run background software, such as a **monitoring agent**, on each node in a cluster. DaemonSets are **not typically used to deploy the main apps** hosted on Kubernetes.

**Question 64**
You are running an application on multiple virtual machines within a managed instance group and have autoscaling enabled. The autoscaling policy is configured so that additional instances are added to the group if the CPU utilization of instances goes above 80%. VMs are added until the instance group reaches its maximum limit of five VMs or until CPU utilization of instances lowers to 80%. The initial delay for HTTP health checks against the instances is set to 30 seconds.

The virtual machine instances take around three minutes to become available for users. You observe that when the instance group autoscales, it adds more instances then necessary to support the levels of end-user traffic. You want to properly maintain instance group sizes when autoscaling. What should you do?

A: Set the maximum number of instances to 1.

B: Decrease the maximum number of instances to 3.

C: Use a TCP health check instead of an HTTP health check.

D: Increase the initial delay of the HTTP health check to 200 seconds.

Answer: D

[Autohealing behavior](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups/autohealing-instances-in-migs#example_health_check_set_up)

- In this example, a VM is marked as healthy if it returns successfully once. It is marked as unhealthy if it returns unsuccessfully 3 consecutive times.

```
gcloud compute health-checks create http example-check --port 80 \
       --check-interval 30s \
       --healthy-threshold 1 \
       --timeout 10s \
       --unhealthy-threshold 3
```

- Apply the health check by configuring an autohealing policy for your regional or zonal MIG.

- The initial-delay setting delays autohealing from potentially prematurely recreating the VM if the VM is in the process of starting up. The initial delay timer starts when the VM's currentAction field changes to VERIFYING

```
gcloud compute instance-groups managed update my-mig \
        --health-check example-check \
        --initial-delay 300 \
        --zone us-east1-b

**Question 66**
You recently deployed a new version of an application to App Engine and then discovered a bug in the release. You need to immediately revert to the prior version of the application. What should you do?

A: Run gcloud app restore.

B: On the App Engine page of the GCP Console, select the application that needs to be reverted and click Revert.

C: On the App Engine Versions page of the GCP Console, route 100% of the traffic to the previous version.

D: Deploy the original version as a separate application. Then go to App Engine settings and split traffic between applications so that the original version serves 100% of the requests.

Answer: D (the correct is C)

- correct is C NOT D.
  Option A is wrong as gcloud app restore was used for backup and restore and has been deprecated.Option B is wrong as there is no application revert functionality available.Option D is wrong as App Engine maintains version and need not be redeployed.

- D - is wrong because there is only one app engine per project. C is correct, you have to split traffic

- Correct option is C. AppEngine already creates a version for you. Also you do not create a application as one project is associated with one AppEngine application.

**Question 67**
You deployed an App Engine application using gcloud app deploy, but it did not deploy to the intended project. You want to find out why this happened and where the application deployed. What should you do?

A: Check the app.yaml file for your application and check project settings.

B: Check the web-application.xml file for your application and check project settings.

C: Go to Deployment Manager and review settings for deployment of applications.

D: Go to Cloud Shell and run gcloud config list to review the Google Cloud configuration used for deployment.

Answer: D

https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/reference/app-yaml?tab=node.js#top

- The app.yaml file configures your App Engine app's settings. It is required to contain at least a runtime entry.

- I would opt option D : as it would help to check the config details and Option A is not correct, as app.yaml would have only the runtime and script to run parameters and not the Project details

```
runtime: nodejs18 # required

instance_class: F2 # Automatic scaling: (**F1**, F2, F4, F4_1G). Basic and manual scaling: (B1, **B2**, B4, B4_1G, B8)

**Question 68**
You want to configure 10 Compute Engine instances for availability when maintenance occurs. Your requirements state that these instances should attempt to automatically restart if they crash. Also, the instances should be highly available including during system maintenance. What should you do?

A: Create an instance template for the instances. Set the'Automatic Restart' to on. Set the'On-host maintenance' to Migrate VM instance. Add the instance template to an instance group.

B: Create an instance template for the instances. Set'Automatic Restart' to off. Set'On-host maintenance' to Terminate VM instances. Add the instance template to an instance group.

C: Create an instance group for the instances. Set the'Autohealing' health check to healthy (HTTP).

D: Create an instance group for the instance. Verify that the'Advanced creation options' setting for'do not retry machine creation' is set to off.

Answer: A

- [Set host maintenance policy of a VM](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/setting-vm-host-options#settingoptions)
- onHostMaintenance: determines the behavior when a maintenance event occurs that might cause your VM to reboot.

  > MIGRATE: causes Compute Engine to live migrate an instance when there is a maintenance event. This is the default value.
  > TERMINATE: stops a VM instead of migrating it.

- automaticRestart: determines the behavior when a VM crashes or is stopped by the system.
  > true: Compute Engine restarts an instance if the instance crashes or is stopped. This is the default value.
  > false: Compute Engine does not restart a VM if the VM crashes or is stopped.

**Question 70**
You have a virtual machine that is currently configured with 2 vCPUs and 4 GB of memory. It is running out of memory. You want to upgrade the virtual machine to have 8 GB of memory. What should you do?

A: Rely on live migration to move the workload to a machine with more memory.

B: Use gcloud to add metadata to the VM. Set the key to required-memory-size and the value to 8 GB.

C: Stop the VM, change the machine type to n1-standard-8, and start the VM.

D: Stop the VM, increase the memory to 8 GB, and start the VM.

Answer: D

- D is correct. If you pay attention to the question, option C mentions n1-standard-8. That instance type has **8vCPUs** and 30 GB RAM, and we only need 8GB. On top of that, it is possible to use custom machine type to adjust current VM RAM to the value we need.
