To whom it may concern,
I am writing this letter to inform you that I have continued strong ties to the US during my absent since November 17, 2020 to current. Here are the documentations bringing with me:
-	U.S. Bank Account (Chase statements)
-	U.S. Tax Return (Form 1040 in 2022, 2021 and 2022 year)
-	Certificate of the fully vaccinated for Covid-19 on August 2021
-	Doctor letter by Katsumi Tanaka MD, Director of Youga Medical Clinic 
-	Looked for U.S. jobs. 
In May 2020 I had coronavirus symptoms with a severe fever and cough and took sick leave for 10 days. During that time, Los Angeles County set Safer-at-Home Order and a curfew[1][2] and the hospitalization cases rose. Because of these circumstances, I didn’t go to a doctor and I self quarantined and treated myself at home using antibiotic medicine and my asthma inhalers. To protect myself and others, I stayed away from the hospital, and this is why I do not have a coronavirus positive result issued by the CDC from that time. The covid infection was triggered to be worsen my asthma symptoms. In addition, because of mental/emotional stress from pandemic, I had irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and lost weigh over 5 pounds.
Because of above medical conditions, I decided to move to Japan on November 17, 2020. Since then, I have been prescribed inhalers and medications for asthma by Katsumi Tanaka MD. 
Omicron variant surges to the US the beginning of 2022. Because my chronic asthma makes me high risk if I were to be infected with Covid-19 (Omicron) again, I couldn’t travel during the pandemic and have been in Japan for a while unable to return until Covid conditions improved.
Should you have any questions, please contact me or Jeffrey Kikuta who is my immigration lawyer in Fragomen, Del Rey, Bernsen & Loewy [3].
Thank you very much for understanding my situation. 
Sincerely,
