To whom it may concern, 
I am writing this letter to inform you that I have continued strong ties to the US during my absence since November 17, 2020 to present. Here are the documents I am bringing with me:
U.S. Bank Account (Chase statements)
U.S. Tax Return (Form 1040 in 2022, 2021 and 2022 year)
Certificate of full vaccination for Covid-19 on August 2021
Doctor letter by Katsumi Tanaka MD, Director of Youga Medical Clinic
Applications to apply for U.S. jobs. 
In May 2020, I had coronavirus symptoms with a severe fever and cough and took sick leave for 10 days. During that time, Los Angeles County set Safer-at-Home Order and a curfew[1][2] and the hospitalization cases rose. Based on these circumstances, I didn’t go to a doctor and I self quarantined to treat myself at home using antibiotic medicine and my asthma inhalers. To protect myself and others, I stayed away from the hospital, and this is why I do not have a coronavirus positive result issued by the CDC from that time. The covid infection worsened my asthma symptoms. In addition, because of mental/emotional stress from the pandemic, I had irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and lost over 5 pounds. 
Because of the above medical conditions, I decided to move back to Japan on November 17, 2020. Since then, I have been prescribed inhalers and medications for asthma by Katsumi Tanaka MD.
Due to Omicron variant surges to the US the beginning of 2022, and because my chronic asthma makes me high risk if I were to be infected with Covid-19 (Omicron) again, I couldn’t travel during the pandemic and have been in Japan unable to return until Covid conditions improved. 
Should you have any questions, please contact me or Jeffrey Kikuta who is my immigration lawyer in Fragomen, Del Rey, Bernsen & Loewy [3]. Thank you very much for understanding my situation. 
Sincerely,


Hiroko Yamaji

To whom it may concern,
Patient Name: Hiroko Yamaji

This is to certify that the following medications have been prescribed for the person listed above, who has chronic asthma. The mediations are:
-	Inhaler 1
-	Inhaler 2

Due to Omicron variant surges to the US at the beginning of 2022, and due to the fact that Ms. Yamaji’s chronic asthma makes her high risk if she were to be infected with COVID-19, she has been in Tokyo, Japan. I request an understanding of Ms. Yamaji’s long absence from the US, to treat and recover for her medical conditions, and request permission of reentry.
